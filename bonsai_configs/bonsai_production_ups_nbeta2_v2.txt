# This is a bonsai config file for a "production-scale" real-time
# search with 16384 frequency channels, searched to max DM 13000.
# It uses 7-8 GB memory/beam, so it will not run on a laptop.
#
# The production-scale bonsai configs differ in number of trial
# spectral indices, and whether an upsampled tree is used to improve
# signal-to-noise for narrow pulses (<~ 1 ms) at DM <= 820.
#
# params_noups_nbeta1.txt: no upsampled tree, 1 trial spectral index.
# params_noups_nbeta2.txt: no upsampled tree, 2 trial spectral indices.
# params_ups_nbeta1.txt:   upsampled tree, 1 trial spectral index.
# params_ups_nbeta2.txt:   upsampled tree, 2 trial spectral indices.
#
# IMPORTANT: the last one (params_ups_nbeta2.txt) is currently running
# too slow, and the L1 server will crash!
#
# As mentioned in ch_frb_l1 MANUAL.md, there is currently a technical
# issue in the bonsai code which requires an artificially large bonsai
# chunk size (8 seconds).  This technical issue also means that if you
# modify the bonsai config file, there's a good chance you'll get
# cryptic errors like:
#
#  bonsai_ups_nbeta2.txt: nt_tree[3]=256 is too small (minimum value for this config = 320)
#
# Just let me know if you need help.  This technical issue will be fixed soon!
#
# For more information on bonsai, including documentation of the configuration
# file and pointers to example programs, a good place to start is MANUAL.md
# in the bonsai repository (https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/bonsai/blob/master/MANUAL.md).
