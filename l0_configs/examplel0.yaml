# This is "example 1", in the section "Quick-start examples
# which can be run on a laptop" in MANUAL.md.

# In this toy example, we use 1 beam and 1024 frequency channels.
#
# In subscale test programs, the value of 'nt_per_packet' isn't very important, but
# should be the same on the L0 simulator and the L1 server.  (For discussion, see
# "Config file reference: L1 server" in MANUAL.md.)

# Total number of threads used by the L0 simulator.

# is the number of distinct (ipaddr,port) pairs (in this case nsteams=1).
