# This is "example 4", in the section "Examples on the two-node McGill backend"
# in MANUAL.md.
#
# It is basically the same as example 3, except that the number of beams has
# been decreased from 16 to 8.


# This is a production-scale example which will monopolize both 20-core nodes
# frb-compute-0 (which acts as the L0 simulator) and frb-compute-1 (which acts
# as the L1 server).  The L1 server will dedisperse 8 beams, with 16384 frequency
# channels.
#
# nt_per_packet=16 is important here, since the 'fast' kernels are hardcoded to
# use nt_per_packet=16.  See MANUAL.md for more dicussion!

# This example assumes the nodes are in a non-link-bonded configuration, where
# each of the four 1 Gbps NIC's is on an independent /24 network.  We use UDP
# port 6677 on two NIC's.  Traffic is divided between NIC's "per beam", 
# i.e. four beams will be sent to each NIC.  (Note that in the 8-beam case,
# we only use two out of four NIC's in the node.)

# Total number of threads used by the L0 simulator.
# Note: nthreads must be a multiple of the number of "streams", which
# is the number of distinct (ipaddr,port) pairs (in this case nstreams=2).
